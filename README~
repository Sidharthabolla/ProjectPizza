README for pizza1_setup
Hopefully all the directories and filenames you need show up in 
this setup.  If not, please email me about it.

However the file contents are largely just copies of related
files from ch05_guitar_shop, so you need to rewrite them.

Please make sure you can run the project on topcat, because
that's where the grader will run it.  See database.php for
code that lets you run on topcat.
